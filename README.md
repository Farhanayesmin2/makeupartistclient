## Install Tailwind CSS

npx tailwindcss init

2.Add the paths to all of your template files in your tailwind.config.js file.
content: ["./src/**/*.{html,js}"],

3. Add the @tailwind directives for each of Tailwindâ€™s layers to your main CSS file, add index.css
   @tailwind base;
   @tailwind components;
   @tailwind utilities;

4.Add link on index.html <link href="/dist/output.css" rel="stylesheet"> and again npm start

`For MUMBA UI`

npm install tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer -D

### Use Plugin for tailwind css

1. npm i flowbite flowbite-react
2. add the content, 'node\*modules/flowbite-react/\*\*/\_.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}'
3. require('flowbite/plugin')

### `npm start`

# install React Router Dom

step: npm install react-router-dom@6

### `npm run build`

In the project use:

1. install flowbite react:https://flowbite-react.com/
2. Tailwind css:https://tailwindcss.com/
3. react router dom:https://reactrouter.com/
   4: firebase install:https://console.firebase.google.com/project/learn-code-b31de/authentication/providers
4. react icons:https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/
5. pdf to react:https://react-pdf.org/
6. toast: https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-toastify
7. React Env: https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables/

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
